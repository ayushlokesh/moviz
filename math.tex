There are many positive integer solutions to the equation 
\[x^2+y^2=z^2\]
which can be rewritten as \[z = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\]
For example \(3,4,5\) or \(5,12,13\)

. Such solutions are called Pythagorean triples.

However, for higher powers the situation is very different, and we have:-

\textbf{Theorem: Fermat-Wiles} For all natural numbers n\geq3
, there are no integers \(x,y,z\) satisfying the equation: \[x^n+y^n=z^n\]
